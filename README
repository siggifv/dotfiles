What is this?
---

This is *my* dotfiles setup - which I am updating, improving and tweaking.

There are probably lots of other **much** better dotfiles, as mine are mostly made up of other people's dotfiles.

This will probably change and might not even work, so beware and use at your own risk if you choose to do so.
